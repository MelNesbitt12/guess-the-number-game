# Guess the Number Game

This simple application allows the user to input a number between 1 and 20 and compares their input to a random 'secret' number. The user is able to guess until either they guess the correct number or they run out of turns.

This mini project is part of 'The Complete JavasScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert' Udemy course. It has been a great way for me to continue practicing JavaScript since finishing up General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp.
